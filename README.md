# Generate-random-word
Inspired to create a simple random non repeated word generator.

Learning British Sign Language and needed a place to generate words every few seconds so that I could practice the sign hence created this program.

## To run the code
In command line:

python generate.py input.txt input1.txt 5

- where there can be unlimited number of input text files separated by space assuming you want to randomise words from different files
- the last parameter is the time in seconds between each word generating
